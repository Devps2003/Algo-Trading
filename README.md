# Reinforcement Learning-Based Algorithmic Trading with Stochastic Control  

Algorithmic trading is at the forefront of financial innovation, and this project explores how Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with Stochastic Control can optimize trading decisions. The system models and simulates asset pricing, evaluates hedging strategies, and measures risk using advanced techniques such as the **Black-Scholes model**, **Monte Carlo simulations**, and **Reinforcement Learning agents**.

  - Stock price graphs based on historical data.
  - Hedging simulation outcomes, including Profit and Loss (P&L) and price paths.
  - Monte Carlo simulation-generated future price paths.

- **Risk Management Tools**: 
  - Implemented the **Black-Scholes model** for calculating option delta and sensitivity.
  - Simulated **Monte Carlo price paths** for better decision-making.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**:
  - The RL agent optimizes trading strategies with actions like *buy, sell, hold*, trained using deep Q-learning.
  - Tracks performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return, and Maximum Drawdown.

## üìö Key Concepts and Definitions  

1. **Black-Scholes Model**:  
   A mathematical model used for pricing options. It provides a way to compute the "delta," which measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price of the underlying asset.  

2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:  
   A method used to simulate the potential future prices of assets by randomly generating paths based on volatility and drift. This helps in estimating risks and evaluating trading strategies.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:  
   An AI paradigm where agents learn optimal strategies by interacting with an environment and maximizing cumulative rewards over time.

4. **Sharpe Ratio**:  
   A measure of risk-adjusted returns, calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Average Excess Return}}{\text{Standard Deviation of Returns}}
   \]

5. **Maximum Drawdown**:  
   The largest observed loss from a peak to a trough during a specific period.

6. **Hedging Strategy**:  
   A financial strategy to minimize risks in investments by taking offsetting positions, often computed using option sensitivities (deltas).

## üìä Main Algorithms  

### 1. **Black-Scholes Model**  
The delta of an option is computed using the formula:  
\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S}{K}) + (r + 0.5 \sigma^2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}  
\]
\[
\text{Delta (Call)} = \Phi(d_1), \quad \text{Delta (Put)} = -\Phi(-d_1)  
\]  
Where \( S \) is the stock price, \( K \) is the strike price, \( T \) is the time to maturity, \( r \) is the risk-free rate, and \( \sigma \) is volatility.  

### 2. **Monte Carlo Simulations**  
Simulates future price paths using the stochastic differential equation:  
\[
S_{t+1} = S_t \cdot \exp((r - 0.5 \sigma^2) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot z_t)  
\]  
Here \( z_t \) is a random sample from a standard normal distribution.  

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**  
A deep Q-network (DQN) is used to train the RL agent, where states represent price paths and actions are buy, sell, or hold. The loss function for training is:  
\[
L = \mathbb{E}[(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a))^2]  
\]
